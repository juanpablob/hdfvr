# HDFVR flash recorder component from NuSoft
##Â About this repo

I made this repo only for [Bower](bower.io) purposes, to act as a component. It only contains neccesary front-end files such as `SWF` and some `XML` and it has `SWFObject` as its dependency. This Bower component or repo is very useful when handling the [HDFVR](www.hdfvr.com) recorder via Javascript API and when you only want to load the `SWF` files and dependencies without caring of include it in your project/repo manually.

###### Notice: If you came here looking for a complete package of HDFVR web components including server-side scripts such as `PHP/ASP/CS`, you should go to the product webpage at [HDFVR](www.hdfvr.com) from [NuSoft](www.nusofthq.com) and download the product files or apply for a trial in order to get those files.

## Updates
Since this is an unnoficial repo from [HDFVR](www.hdfvr.com), I can't guarantee regular updates as NuSoft releases new versions of scripts.
